You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other 
creatures. You must have heard the speech or sound for at least 1

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with the weapon.\n
On your turn, you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance, 
provided you have the weapon in hand. Doing so grants you a +1 bonus 
to your AC until the start of your next turn or until youâ€™re not 
holding the weapon.\n

on the attack roll.
